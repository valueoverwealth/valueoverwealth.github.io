                <p class="p-3 text-md">Being wealthy sounds great. But if you are wealthy you know or will soon discover it is actually about value more than wealth.
                    I can help you organise & arrange your wealth so that you can spend time and focus on what is valuable to you. Whether you are an individual,
                    a family or a foundation. Wealth creates opportunities. You have the luxury of choice. But wealth comes with responsibilities and requires
                    maintenance. You are approached by all sorts of people that want to piggyback on your wealth in one way or another.
                    You receive conflicting ideas and advice. Who is looking after your interests and agenda in such an increasingly complex environment?

                <p class="p-3">
                    Over many years of my career I have worked as a service provider to families in different countries and learnt to appreciate that wealth can be a blessing as well as a burden.
                    I have seen wealth melting away due to poor investment decisions, self-interested advisors, suboptimal structures and poor planning. Too often I have seen wealth becoming a source of worry,
                    a threat to family ties and harmony and lead to unhappiness in many ways.
                    Over my 25+ years in International Finance I have built up a broad knowledge & experience in what drives banks, wealth managers, investment firms, fiscal and other advisors.
                    I have gained insight into the workings of the investment world and how successful families
                    manage to find the right balance so they are able to get real value from their wealth.
